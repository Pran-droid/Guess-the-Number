# Guess-the-Number
The code for a <b>Number Guessing Game</b> by me in <b>C</b>.
<div>So, this game is single and double player.</div>
<p>Single Player-</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guess a no. from 1 to 100</li>
  <li>If the supposed no. is greater than the actual no. it will incidate higher </li>
  <li>If the supposed no. is lesser than the actual no. it will incidate lower</li>
  <li>Until you guess it right and will show the no. of attempts you took to get it right</li>
  <li>Can play again to reduce those no. of attempts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Double Player-</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each player gets unlike no. to guesss which is form 1 to 100</li>
  <li>One with least no. of attempts WINS.</li>  
</ul>

<p>There is a .c-file attached where you will find an error free code.
  <br> You can run it on any C compiler and start playing. <b>Enjoy!</b></p>
